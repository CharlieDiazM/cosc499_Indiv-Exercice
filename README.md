# Palindrome Program

- 1st Feature
In the first feature of the palindrome program, the program asks the user to input an integer.
After the user has entered the integer and hits Enter, the code will inverse the number that the user has provided 
and, after it has finished doing this, compares the input from the user with the inversed number. 
If the integer is palindrome, the program will return true.
However, if the integer is not palindrome, the code will return false.
